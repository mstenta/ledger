General Concepts:

Ledger Accounts
  Contain Ledger Entries.

Ledger Entries
  Describe a change in value in an account. Includes a timestamp, an account ID, and a value (positive or negative).

Ledger Transactions
  Describes the movement of value between accounts via Entries.
  Transactions are made up of Entries, which contain the actual information about what account is being credited/debited, and what the value of the credit/debit is.
  Each Transaction must have at least 2 Entries. More can be used when splitting transactions across multiple accounts.
